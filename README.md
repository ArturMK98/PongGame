# PongGame
A simple pong game made in Python.

## How to play
- To move the left paddle up and down use the 'w' and 's' keys.
- To move the right paddle up and down use the 'Up' and 'Down' arrow keys.
- Each time the ball goes behind one of the paddles it counts as a point

## Future plans
- Make it so that the paddles can't move off the top and bottom of the screen 
- Implement an interactive menu
- Add a way to end a game (Set a score limit or let the user pick a score limit)
- Let the user pick custom settings (Speed of the ball, Speed of the paddles, Select themes)
- Add more sounds and a background song that can be muted and unmuted by the user
- Give the user a choice to play against an AI
